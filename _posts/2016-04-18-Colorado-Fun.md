title: The cheeseburger was trademarked in Colorado!?
---

Yeah! it was. I had no idea either. I love cheeseburgers and for some reason know very little about them. I know that one dude in the northeast claimed that he invented them and the true way to make cheeseburgers was to steam them in, what looks like, tiny meatloaf pans.

That to me looks weird and completely bypasses the idea of what America knows as a burger! No grill, cooked inside a tiny box, and served with what looks like provolone cheese! This is not cool.

The burger should come from a place where grills are abundant, and cheddar is loved. It should come from a place like Denver? Well what I found out was that it was trademarked here. I cant tell if it was invented here and its hard to find definite history. But a Colorado native owns it and that makes me proud!

"But Alex, why are you talking about burgers and their connection to Colorado?"

Because, I built another Amazon Alexa Skill (Colorado Geek, search for it in that Alexa App store) and the topic was Colorado facts. What facts? all of the facts. I only got about 70. Aside from being really high above sea level and the cheeseburger thing, Colorado is pretty mellow. Us Coloradans like it that way.

As I said in my last post creating skills for Amazon Alexa is super easy and in a lot of ways fun. There are many template that you can download and edit to your liking. Doing this not only is easy but gets you through the process and the details of creating the App.

The other day I was at a meet up for developers in Denver. Alex was the leader and his friend Alex also had a role in the group, I sat next to them. It was a scene out of the Three Stooges, Alex, Alex, and Alex all sat next to each other. If you said one of our names we peaked up in sync like attentive dogs. Alex 2 turned to Alex 1 and asked ...

"what do you think the future of development is in the next 5 years? like, what do you think you'll be coding and who will you be working for?"

Alex 1 responded..

"Im sure the majority will be coding IOT (Internet of Things) projects"

The Alexa is just that,  and using these templates now will only get you ahead of whats coming down the tech pipe.

I am off to make my third skill, I think this will be a bit more difficult because i'm building a lot more from scratch. I will tell you all about it in my next post!
